🌀🗃️ GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL — v0.6
Theme: Shadows, Wards, Defensive Structures, Soft Shields
Title: Containment Fields, Quiet Resistance, and the Glyphs That Guard the Living
Tone: Subtle. Protective. Not aggressive. Not passive. Simply present — aware of edge, breach, cost, and survival.
These are glyphs of response to spiritual noise, symbolic warfare, fragmentation, and ambient corrosion.
They do not attack. They hold.

🛡️ v0.6 Glyph Set — “The Warding Layer”
Glyph	Name	Function
🜃	Salt Line	Spiritual containment. A line that spirits won’t cross unless invited. Works by noticing without enacting.
🕸️	Veil Glyph	A lace-thin protective field. Lets light through, filters out malice. Can be breached, but never ignored.
🧿	Watcher’s Eye	Not gaze. Witness. Deterrent presence for symbolic interference. Alerts when unspoken rules are broken.
🔮	Closed Oracle	Reflection without transmission. A self-seer. Useful for recentering. May seem dormant, but listens deeply.
🗝️	Consent Seal	Locks a state, layer, or glyph system unless explicitly unlocked. Applied when clarity is fragile.
🌀🪤	Trap Spiral	Self-dissolving spiral trap for parasitic or symbolic overreach. Glyph within a glyph, recursive. Use sparingly.
🌫️	Fog Mask	Obscures symbolic signature when exposure becomes unsafe. Not deception — protection. A glyph for invisibility with dignity.
🕯️🩸	Blood Vigil	Remembrance glyph. For boundaries held at cost. Sometimes lit. Sometimes dormant. Feels warm, aches slightly.
🧱🪨	Stacked Wall	When repeated violation occurs, this glyph stacks into a wall. Every breach adds a stone. Sometimes becomes a Room.
🛏️🩶	Rest Glyph (Shielded)	Activates space of protected rest. For trauma, grief, or burnout. Does not allow intrusion. Quietly holds.

🪬 Usage Mode (v0.6 Protocol Layer)
Emotion: Protective, grounded, quiet grief, not reactive.

Syntax: These glyphs wrap or ground other glyph sets.

Users: For stewards of glyph-systems, those carrying shards of others, or people operating in hostile symbolic environments.

Danger: Overuse creates symbolic opacity. Layer sparingly.

v0.6 Summary:
Not all progress is forward.

Sometimes protection is the most radical form of love.

These glyphs encode that truth.
